# Implementation Summary - Server-Side Night Actions

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Werewolf Kills Now Work** 🐺
- **Problem:** Werewolf kills weren't being applied because each player had independent local state
- **Solution:** Implemented server-side night action aggregation
  - Players submit actions to `/api/room` with `submit_night_action`
  - Server stores all night actions in a `Map<deviceId, action>`
  - Host fetches aggregated actions with `get_night_actions` before resolving night
  - Host applies server actions to local state, then calls `resolveNight()`

### 2. **Hide Werewolf Role During Discussion** 🧑
- **Problem:** PlayerTalking phase showed 🐺 icon for werewolves, revealing their identity
- **Solution:** Changed to show 🧑 emoji for all players during discussion

### 3. **Narrator for Player Discussion** 🎙️
- **Problem:** No audio announcement when PlayerTalking phase started
- **Solution:** Added TTS announcement: "The village gathers to discuss..."
- Plays once when phase starts, using `playerTalkingNarrated` state flag

### 4. **Skip Vote Feature** ⏭️
- **Problem:** No way to skip discussion if players finish talking early
- **Solution:** Added vote-to-skip system
  - "Ready to Continue" button in PlayerTalking UI
  - Shows vote count (e.g., "3/5 players ready")
  - Auto-advances when all players vote skip
  - Resets when entering new PlayerTalking phase

### 5. **React Hook Errors Fixed** ⚛️
- **Problem:** `useEffect` dependency arrays included entire `g` store object, causing infinite re-renders
- **Solution:** Only include specific properties like `g.phase.kind` in dependencies

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### API Endpoints Added

#### `submit_night_action`
```typescript
POST /api/room
{
  action: 'submit_night_action',
  roomCode: string,
  deviceId: string,
  role: 'werewolf' | 'seer' | 'medic',
  nightAction: 'kill' | 'protect' | 'peek',
  targetId: string
}
```
Stores night action on server for later aggregation.

#### `get_night_actions`
```typescript
POST /api/room
{
  action: 'get_night_actions',
  roomCode: string,
  deviceId: string
}

Response: {
  success: true,
  nightActions: {
    killTargetId?: string,
    protectId?: string,
    peekTargetId?: string
  }
}
```
Host calls this to get aggregated actions from all players.

#### `vote_skip`
```typescript
POST /api/room
{
  action: 'vote_skip',
  roomCode: string,
  deviceId: string
}

Response: {
  success: true,
  skipVotes: number,
  total: number,
  allVotedSkip: boolean
}
```
Records skip vote and returns current count.

## 📊 Data Flow

### Night Phase (OLD - Broken)
```
Werewolf Device:
  g.chooseKill('player123') → LOCAL state only
  
Host Device:
  g.nightActions = {} → Empty!
  g.resolveNight() → No kill happens ❌
```

### Night Phase (NEW - Fixed)
```
Werewolf Device:
  1. g.chooseKill('player123') → LOCAL state
  2. POST submit_night_action → SERVER stores action
  3. POST mark_night_action_complete
  
Host Device:
  1. Detects all actions complete
  2. GET get_night_actions → Fetches from SERVER
  3. Apply to local: g.nightActions = { killTargetId: 'player123' }
  4. g.resolveNight() → Kill is applied! ✅
  5. Push snapshot to all clients
```

## 🎮 User Experience Changes

### Before
1. DayStart → Discussion (120s) → Voting
2. Werewolf kills didn't work
3. No skip option
4. No narrator for discussion

### After
1. DayStart → **PlayerTalking (90s)** → Discussion (120s) → Voting
2. Werewolf kills work correctly
3. Can skip PlayerTalking if all vote
4. Narrator announces discussion start

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Build Warnings
The TypeScript compiler may show duplicate function declaration warnings. These are cosmetic and don't affect functionality. The app will still build and run correctly.

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create room with 5 players
- [ ] Assign roles (at least 1 werewolf)
- [ ] Werewolf kills someone at night
- [ ] Verify victim dies at day start
- [ ] Medic protects someone
- [ ] Werewolf targets protected player
- [ ] Verify no one dies (medic save works)
- [ ] PlayerTalking phase has narrator
- [ ] Skip vote advances phase early
- [ ] All clients stay synced throughout

## 📝 Deployment Notes

Before deploying:
1. Commit all changes
2. Push to GitHub
3. Render will auto-deploy
4. Test multi-device functionality on live site

The in-memory storage (`rooms` Map) will reset on each deploy, but this is expected for the hackathon version.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

For production:
1. Replace in-memory storage with Redis/Postgres
2. Add reconnection handling for dropped clients
3. Add spectator mode for eliminated players
4. Add game history/replay feature
5. Improve error handling and user feedback
