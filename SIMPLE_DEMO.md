# SIMPLE DEMO - No Python Required!

## ðŸŽ¯ The Problem
Running terminal commands and Python agents is annoying for a demo. Let's make it **dead simple**.

## âœ… New Simple Solution

### **Option 1: Just Use the Werewolf Mode (Easiest)**

Your existing Werewolf mode already works perfectly! It has:
- âœ… AI narrator (uses your Baseten/JanitorAI)
- âœ… Voice recognition
- âœ… Multiple players
- âœ… Full game logic

**To demo:**
1. Run: `npm run dev`
2. Open: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Click "Werewolf"
4. Add players
5. Start game
6. Pass device around (or use one device per player on same WiFi)

**For friends to join on their devices:**
1. Find your IP: `ipconfig`
2. Friends go to: `http://YOUR_IP:3000`
3. Everyone plays Werewolf mode
4. Each person on their own device

**No Python needed. No terminal commands. Just works!**

### **Option 2: Simplified Judge Mode (No Python)**

I can modify the Judge mode to work without Python:

**How it would work:**
- Remove the Python agent requirement
- Use your existing `/api/host` endpoint directly
- Players still join from multiple devices
- Judge responses come from your Baseten/JanitorAI
- All through the browser - no Python!

**Would you like me to implement this?**

## ðŸš€ For CalHacks Demo - Use Werewolf Mode!

### **Step 1: Start**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Open Browser**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### **Step 3: Demo**
1. Click "Werewolf"
2. Add 4-5 players
3. Assign roles
4. Start game
5. Show off the AI narrator
6. Show off voice recognition

### **Step 4: Multi-Device (Optional)**
- Find IP: `ipconfig` â†’ 192.168.1.X

## ðŸ’¡ What to Tell Judges

"We built an AI-powered social deduction game using:
- **Next.js** for the frontend
- **LiveKit** for real-time voice (or Web Speech API as fallback)
- **Baseten/JanitorAI** for custom AI narrator
- **Multi-device support** - everyone on their own phone
- Built in [X] days for CalHacks!"

**Show them:**
1. The AI narrator responding to game events
2. Voice recognition working
3. Multiple players on different devices
4. The game logic and UI

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation

**For CalHacks demo: Use Werewolf mode!**

Why?
- âœ… Already fully working
- âœ… No Python setup needed
- âœ… No terminal commands
- âœ… Just `npm run dev` and go
- âœ… Impressive AI narrator
- âœ… Multi-device capable
- âœ… Full game logic implemented

The Judge mode is cool, but adds complexity. The Werewolf mode is your **polished, working demo**.

## ðŸ”§ If You Really Want Judge Mode Without Python

I can create a version that:
1. Runs entirely in Next.js (no Python)
2. Uses your existing AI endpoints
3. Works on multiple devices
4. Single command to start: `npm run dev`

**Should I build this?** Or just use Werewolf mode for the demo?

Let me know and I'll make it happen! ðŸš€
