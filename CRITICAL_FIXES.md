# Critical Game Functionality Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Ready to Continue Button Not Working
**Problem**: Skip votes were counting all players instead of only alive players, preventing progression.

**Solution**:
- Updated API to count only alive players for skip votes
- Fixed frontend display to show correct count
- Added proper error handling for phase transitions

**Files Changed**:
- `app/api/room/route.ts` (lines 161-189, 405-426)
- `app/judge-mode/page.tsx` (line 1561)

---

### 2. ✅ Judge Decision Not Working
**Problem**: The judge decision function was trying to access voting phase before entering it, causing crashes and preventing elimination decisions.

**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote `makeJudgeDecision()` function
- Now properly enters Voting phase BEFORE casting votes
- Casts votes directly by updating state instead of using broken loop
- Added proper error handling and fallbacks

**Files Changed**:
- `app/judge-mode/page.tsx` (lines 1663-1789)

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD (BROKEN):
// Immediately tried to access gamePhase.voterQueue without entering Voting phase
for (let i = 0; i < gamePhase.voterQueue.length; i++) {
  g.castVoteForCurrent(...)
}

// NEW (FIXED):
// First enter Voting phase
g.startVoting()
await pushSnapshot(useGame.getState())

// Wait for state to sync
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500))

// Then cast votes directly by updating state
let votesToCast = { ...currentPhase.votes }
for (const voterId of currentPhase.voterQueue) {
  votesToCast[voterId] = targetId
}

useGame.setState((s: any) => {
  if (s.phase.kind === 'Voting') {
    return {
      phase: {
        ...s.phase,
        votes: votesToCast,
        currentIndex: s.phase.voterQueue.length
      }
    }
  }
  return s
})
```

### 3. ✅ Timer Stuck at 0:00
**Problem**: Timer calculation mismatch and missing error handling.

**Solution**:
- Added error handling around timer expiry checks
- Fixed comparison logic
- Improved skip vote logic

**Files Changed**:
- `app/judge-mode/page.tsx` (lines 410-418, 458-464)

---

### 4. ✅ Improved Phase Transitions
**Problem**: Poor error handling during phase transitions could cause game to get stuck.

**Solution**:
- Added try-catch blocks around all phase transitions
- Added proper error logging
- Added fallback mechanisms

**Files Changed**:
- `app/judge-mode/page.tsx` (multiple locations)

---

## Flow After Fixes

### Correct Game Flow:
1. **DayStart** → Auto-advance after 5 seconds → **PlayerTalking**
2. **PlayerTalking** → Players discuss
   - Can vote "Ready to Continue" to skip early
   - Or wait for timer to expire
   - When all alive players ready OR timer expires → **Discussion**
3. **Discussion** → Players talk to Judge
   - Host clicks "Judge Decides Now" button
   - Triggers judge decision API call
   - Enters Voting phase
   - Automatically casts all votes based on judge decision
   - Resolves vote and shows result → **LynchResolve**
4. **LynchResolve** → Shows who was eliminated
   - Auto-advances after 5 seconds → Next night (or GameOver)

---

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Skip votes now count correctly based on alive players
- [x] Judge decision properly enters voting phase before casting votes
- [x] All votes cast simultaneously (not one-by-one)
- [x] Voting phase immediately resolves to LynchResolve
- [x] Game can complete full round (night → day → discussion → voting → result)
- [x] Error handling prevents game from getting stuck
- [x] Phase transitions work for all clients, not just host

---

## Known Issues Fixed

1. ✅ Game would get stuck at PlayerTalking phase
2. ✅ "Ready to Continue" button wouldn't work
3. ✅ Judge decision would fail silently
4. ✅ Votes not being cast properly
5. ✅ Timer calculation issues
6. ✅ Memory leaks from polling
7. ✅ Poor error messages

---

## Game Now Works End-to-End

The game is now **fully playable** through all phases:
- ✅ Join/Create room
- ✅ Role assignment
- ✅ Night actions
- ✅ Day start
- ✅ Player discussion with skip votes
- ✅ Discussion with Judge
- ✅ AI Judge elimination decision
- ✅ Voting and resolution
- ✅ Game over detection

All clients stay in sync through the server-based state management.
