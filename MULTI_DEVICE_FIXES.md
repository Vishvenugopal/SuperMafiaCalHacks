# Multi-Device Judge Mode - Fixes Applied

## 🐛 Problem Reported
"After I click start, it only asks and shows the host their role, and the other users are stuck in the lobby screen with waiting for host to start..."

## ✅ Root Cause
When the host clicked "Start Game", it only updated **local client-side state**. Other devices were still polling the lobby and had no idea the game started.

---

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### **1. Added Game Phase Tracking to Server** ✅
**File:** `app/api/room/route.ts`

- Added `gamePhase: 'lobby' | 'playing'` to Room interface
- Rooms now track whether they're in lobby or playing state
- New `start_game` API action to update phase server-side

**Before:**
```typescript
interface Room {
  code: string
  hostId: string
  players: Array<...>
  gameState: any
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
interface Room {
  code: string
  hostId: string
  players: Array<...>
  gamePhase: 'lobby' | 'playing'  // NEW!
  gameState: any
}
```

### **2. Host Calls Server When Starting** ✅
**File:** `app/judge-mode/page.tsx`

Updated `startGame()` function to:
1. Call `/api/room` with action `'start_game'`
2. Server updates `gamePhase` to `'playing'`
3. Then start local game

**Before:**
```typescript
const startGame = () => {
  g.reset()
  roomPlayers.forEach(p => g.addPlayer(p.name))
  g.startGame()
  setPhase('playing')  // Only local!
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
const startGame = async () => {
  // Tell server first!
  await fetch('/api/room', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ action: 'start_game', roomCode, deviceId })
  })
  
  // Then start locally
  g.reset()
  roomPlayers.forEach(p => g.addPlayer(p.name))
  g.startGame()
  setPhase('playing')
}
```

### **3. All Devices Detect Game Start** ✅
**File:** `app/judge-mode/page.tsx`

Updated lobby polling to check `gamePhase`:
- Every 2 seconds, check room state
- If `gamePhase === 'playing'`, automatically:
  - Initialize game with all players
  - Start game locally
  - Switch to 'playing' phase

**Code Added:**
```typescript
// In lobby polling useEffect
if (data.gamePhase === 'playing') {
  console.log('Game started! Switching to playing phase...')
  
  g.reset()
  data.players.forEach(p => g.addPlayer(p.name))
  g.startGame()
  
  setPhase('playing')
  return // Stop polling lobby
}
```

## 🎮 Additional Fixes Applied

### **4. Host Controls for Phase Progression** ✅

Added host buttons to advance through phases:

#### **Role Assignment → Night**
- **Problem:** After revealing roles, no way to proceed
- **Fix:** Added "Everyone Ready → Begin Night" button (host only)

#### **Night Actions → Day**
- **Problem:** After night actions, no way to resolve night
- **Fix:** Added "All Actions Complete → Resolve Night" button (host only)

### **5. Role Reveal Auto-Reset** ✅
- **Problem:** `roleRevealed` stays true across rounds
- **Fix:** Auto-reset when entering RoleAssignment phase

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (g.phase.kind === 'RoleAssignment') {
    setRoleRevealed(false)
  }
}, [g.phase.kind])
```
