## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Architecture:**
```
Multi-Device Judge Mode
├── Server-Side Room State (/api/room)
│   ├── Room creation & joining
│   ├── Player tracking
│   ├── Host management
│   └── Game state sync
├── Client-Side Game Logic (Zustand)
│   ├── Phase management
│   ├── Role assignments
│   ├── Night actions

│   └── Narrator announcements
└── Voice Features
    ├── Speech-to-text (STT)
    ├── Text-to-speech (TTS)
    └── Real-time transcription
```

### **State Synchronization:**
- **Lobby:** Polls `/api/room` every 2 seconds for player updates
- **Playing:** Host pushes game state changes to server
- **Clients:** All non-host devices poll for game state updates

### **AI Judge Logic:**
```javascript
makeJudgeDecision()
  → Fetch alive players
  → Call AI with discussion context
  → Parse AI response for player name or "ABSTAIN"
  → Cast votes accordingly
  → Resolve lynch
```

## 🚀 What's Different from Werewolf Mode

| Feature | Werewolf Mode | Judge Mode |

| Devices | Single device (pass-and-play) | Multi-device (room codes) |
| Voting | All players vote | Only AI Judge decides |
| Discussion | Talk to Narrator | Talk to Judge with voice |
| Role Reveal | Pass device person-to-person | Each device shows own role |
| State | Local Zustand only | Server-synced via API |

## 🎯 Key Differences You Requested

✅ **Multi-device** - Everyone on their own phone/device  
✅ **Only Judge votes** - Players don't vote, Judge decides  
✅ **Talk to Judge** - Voice interaction during discussion  
✅ **Narrator still exists** - For game flow announcements  
✅ **Judge makes decisions** - AI analyzes and eliminates  
✅ **Push-to-talk** - Hold mic button to speak  
✅ **All roles work** - Werewolf, Seer, Medic, Villager

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Host advances phases** - Non-hosts wait (by design for control)
2. **Night actions don't sync** - Each player acts independently (works fine)
3. **No real-time chat** - Voice is one-way to Judge (by design)
4. **Judge decision is host-triggered** - Host clicks "Let Judge Decide"

These are intentional design choices for simplicity and control.
