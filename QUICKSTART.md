- Judge responds using your Baseten/JanitorAI setup
- Only one person can talk at a time

## Troubleshooting

**"Agent won't connect"**
- Make sure you entered the same room code in both places
- Room code format: `ABC123` (6 characters)
- Check Terminal 2 for error messages

**"Can't find python"**
Try: `python3 agent/simple_judge.py`

**"Module not found"**
Run: `pip install -r agent/requirements.txt`

**"Can't join from phone"**
- Make sure phone is on same WiFi
- Find your computer's IP: `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac)
- Use `http://192.168.x.x:3000` (replace with your IP)

- Everyone hears the Judge
- Only the speaking player's audio goes to the Judge
- Judge uses your existing AI setup (no extra costs!)

## Demo Tips

1. **Test beforehand** - Run through the flow once
2. **Have backup devices ready** - 2-3 phones minimum
3. **Explain the tech** - "Real-time voice with LiveKit + our custom AI"
4. **Show the code** - The agent code is surprisingly simple!
5. **Mention CalHacks** - Built specifically for this hackathon

Good luck! üöÄ
